### Some tools used in data science
![](Slide1.png)

R, Python, Tableau, Spotfire, Power BI

### This demo covers the R-based tools
![](Slide2.png)

R, R-Studio, Plotly  and now CanvasXpress 

### Let's start by including all the libraries for the demo

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(canvasXpress)
```

### Next, let's use the mtcars data set as example a make a simple scatter plot in ggplot.

```{r}
s <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point()
s
```


Produces a nice and simple visualization. However, a user cannot interact with it.

### Scatter plot with plotly

```{r}
ggplotly(s)
```

Mouse-over to show tooltip and mouse-over on-top of graph to show a toolbar with some functionality. Double-click to reset.

### Scatter plot with canvasXpress

```{r}
canvasXpress(s)
```

Mouse-over to show tooltip, mouse-wheel to zoom in/out, mouse-drag to pan, click to select and mouse-over on-top of graph to show a toolbar with extensive functionality. Press "ESC" to reset.

### Very small differences in the three graphs above
![](Slide3.png)

When you compare the three graphs above, you noticed that the main difference is in the toolbars. ggplot doesn't have one but plotly and canvasXpress do.

![](Slide4.png)

This is a brief comparison of the toolbars in plotly and canvasxpress. There is some corresponding functionality in the toolbars of the two libraries. Items in red are unique to each library)  

## CanvasXpress has extensive functionality out-of-the-box without the need of extra coding

### Click in the funnel icon to explore the data
![](Slide5.png)

### Click in the table icon to see the data in a table
![](Slide6.png)

### Click in the tools icon to customize the data
![](Slide7.png)

## Value proposition

![](Slide8.png)

This demo shows just a very small set of the CanvasXpress functionality. I would be happy to show you a demo!

### Other examples for you to play

Boxplot plot with ggplot

```{r}
b <- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) + geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)
b
```

Boxplot plot with plotly .... 
hmmmm I guess plotly cannot notch the boxplots
```{r}
ggplotly(b)
```

Boxplot plot with canvasXpress

```{r}
canvasXpress(b)
```

Smooth with ggplot

```{r}
sm <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point(aes(color=drv)) + geom_smooth()
sm
```

Smooth with plotly

```{r}
ggplotly(sm)
```

Smooth with canvasXpress

```{r}
canvasXpress(sm)
```


Contour plot with ggplot

```{r}
data(franke, package = "interp")
  origdata <- as.data.frame(interp::franke.data(1, 1, franke))
  grid <- with(origdata, interp::interp(x, y, z))
  griddf <- subset(data.frame(x = rep(grid$x, nrow(grid$z)),
                              y = rep(grid$y, each = ncol(grid$z)),
                              z = as.numeric(grid$z)),
                   !is.na(z))
c <- ggplot(griddf, aes(x, y, z = z)) +
    geom_contour_filled() +
    geom_point(data = origdata)
c
```

Contour plot with plotly ...... hmmmm It doesn't work with plotly :-)

```{r}
ggplotly(c)
```

Contour plot with canvasXpress

```{r}
canvasXpress(c)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
